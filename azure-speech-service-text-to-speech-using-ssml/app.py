Azure TTS with SSML Fine-Tuning

This demonstrates how to use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) to fine-tune 
voice characteristics beyond the default settings.

WHAT THIS SHOWS:
- Using SSML for precise voice control (speed, pitch, volume)
- Fine-tuning voice characteristics for specific use cases
- Going beyond basic text-to-speech with advanced prosody control

THE APPROACH:
- Use SSML markup for explicit voice parameter control
- Set consistent prosody values across all TTS calls
- Demonstrate professional voice customization techniques

WHY USE SSML FOR VOICE FINE-TUNING:
==================================

üîß BASIC APPROACH (default voice settings):
    speech_config.speech_synthesis_voice_name = "en-US-AriaNeural"
    synthesizer.speak_text_async("Hello there!")
    
    LIMITATIONS:
    - Uses default voice characteristics
    - No control over speech rate, pitch, or volume
    - Limited customization options
    - Good for basic TTS, but not for fine-tuned applications

‚ú® SSML APPROACH (fine-tuned control):
    <speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="en-US">
        <voice name="en-US-AriaNeural">
            <prosody rate="0.9" pitch="+5%" volume="soft">
                Hello there!
            </prosody>
        </voice>
    </speak>
    
    ADVANTAGES:
    - Precise control over speech characteristics
    - Fine-tune rate, pitch, and volume to exact specifications
    - Create consistent branded voice experiences
    - Professional-grade voice customization

SSML = Speech Synthesis Markup Language
- XML-based markup for advanced speech control
- Industry standard for professional TTS applications
- Enables voice branding and consistent user experiences
- Supports advanced features like emphasis, breaks, and pronunciation
